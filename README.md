Experiments with Geospatial data for the Ethereum blockchain.

### Use 
Let's say you want to build an automated payment platform that tracks and charges when some(one/thing) passes into a 
geographical space which you own the rights to use. Maybe it's a visitor, drone, automobile, etc.

This contract will automate the setting of that boundary and the payment processing when it is crossed. Locations could be anywhere
that a geographical boundary applies (which can be verified via a geolocation). Think an amusement park, a toll booth, or airspace.
